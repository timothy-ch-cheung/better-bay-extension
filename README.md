## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Making production build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Features
When browsing eBay and sorting items by price low-high, we often get inaccurate results due to adding a cheaper item in the listing to rank higher in the sort. For example: 
![Issue Description](./docs/issue.gif)
The lowest priced item on the usb c cable listing is Â£0.99 but the actual item that it corresponds to is a sim ejector pin.

Better Bay Extension adds tooltips to pre-fetch that information to save you from clicking into the listing:

You can also enable beta features to filter out potentially misleading listings:
